# JupyterLab Example

This provides nix-shell environment with both JupyterLab and hasktorch.

This example should be run from the `experimental/jupyter/` directory.

First, run nix-shell with cachix.

```
nix-env -i cachix
cachix use hasktorch
nix-shell --option sandbox false --command "jupyter lab"
```

The command outputs a url to connect to JupyterLab.
Then, open your browser with the url.
