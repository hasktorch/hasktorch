# Hasktorch 0.2 Pre-Release

Hasktorch is a library for tensors and neural networks in Haskell.
It is an independent open source community project which leverages the core C++ libraries shared by PyTorch.

This project is in active development, so expect changes to the library API as it evolves.
We would like to invite new users to join our Hasktorch slack space for questions and discussions.

Contributions/PR are encouraged (see Contributing).

Currently we are prepping development and migration for a major 2nd release, Hasktorch 0.2.
The 1st release, Hasktorch 0.1, that you can find on hackage is outdated and should not be used at this point.

## Project Structure

Basic functionality:

- `deps/` - submodules and downloads for build dependencies (libtorch, mklml, pytorch) -- you can ignore this if you are on Nix
- `examples/` - high level example models (xor mlp, typed cnn, etc.)
- `experimental/` - experimental projects or tips
- `hasktorch/` - higher level user-facing library, calls into `ffi/`, used by `examples/`

Internals (for contributing developers):

- `codegen/` - code generation, parses `Declarations.yaml` spec from pytorch and produces `ffi/` contents
- `inline-c/` - submodule to inline-cpp fork used for C++ FFI
- `libtorch-ffi/`- low level FFI bindings to libtorch
- `spec/` - specification files used for `codegen/`


## Getting Started

The following steps will get you started.
They assume the hasktorch repository has just been cloned.


### On macOS or Ubuntu-like OSes'

For Nix-based operation, see the following section.

Starting at the top-level directory of the project,
go to the `deps/` (dependencies) directory and run the `get-deps.sh` shell script to retrieve project dependencies with the following commands:

```sh
$ pushd deps           # Change to deps directory and save the current directory.
$ ./get-deps.sh        # Run the shell script to retrieve the dependency.
$ popd                 # Go back to the root directory of the project.
```

This will default to CPU-only Torch.
If you would like to use CUDA 9 or 10,
replace `./get-deps.sh` with `./get-deps.sh -a cu92` or `./get-deps.sh -a cu102`, respectively.

These downloads include various PyTorch shared libraries.
Note that `get-deps.sh` only has to be run once after the repo is initially cloned.
It should *not* be run when using Nix, see the following section.

Next, set shell environment to reference the shared library locations:

```sh
$ source setenv
```

Note `source setenv` should be run from the top-level directory of the repo.

### Via a Nix Shell

These instructions apply both to NixOS and macOS or Ubuntu-like OSes' in which the `nix` package manager can be installed.

The first thing to consider is that the Hasktorch `nix` derivations are large.
For this reason, it is recommended to install and set up Cachix,
e.g. via `nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install` or, on NixOS, directly in your `configuration.nix`.

There are two relevant caches you want to use:

```sh
$ cachix use iohk
$ cachix use hasktorch
```

The first one is maintained by [IOHK](https://iohk.io/).
We use it because we depend on [haskell.nix](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix),
an alternative Haskell Nix infrastructure that we prefer over the default one provided by `nixpkgs`.
The second cache is our own Hasktorch cache.
Using these caches can speed up your builds tremendously.

You can launch a Nix shell via

```sh
$ nix-shell
```

We also support Stack with Nix, see below.

Note that this shell is configured to use the CPU backend only.
In order to benefit from any CUDA-capable hardware acceleration your computer may provide (sorry macOS users),
launch the Nix shell instead with:

```sh
$ nix-shell --arg cudaSupport true --argstr cudaMajorVersion 10
```

### Getting Started in Nix-shell

On Linux and OS X the code below will:

 * Build hasktorch and examples
 * Run unit tests
 * Download MNIST dataset into common directory
 * Run static-mnist-cnn
 * Drop you in repl with hasktorch imported

```sh
$ nix-shell
$ cabal build hasktorch
$ cabal test hasktorch
$ cabal build examples
$ cabal test examples
$ cd examples
$ ./datasets/download-mnist.sh 
$ cp -r mnist data
$ export DEVICE=cpu
$ cabal run static-mnist-cnn
$ cd ..
$ cabal repl hasktorch
```

### Troubleshooting Nix-shell under Windows

Hasktorch mainly works on Windows Subsystem for Linux 2. 
Tested on Debian and Ubuntu.
It is not quite as roubust, but these extra command gets it to work:

```sh
$ nix-shell
$ cabal update
$ haskell-language-server
$ code .
```

There is better integration of VS Code with Ubuntu.

#### Known Nix Shell Issues

##### Tensors Cannot Be Moved to CUDA

In rare cases, you may see errors like

```
cannot move tensor to "CUDA:0"
```

although you have CUDA capable hardware in your machine and
have started the Nix shell with CUDA support.

If that happens, check if you have `/run/opengl-driver/lib`
in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in the Nix shell.
If not, run

```
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/run/opengl-driver/lib
```

to add it.

##### Weird Behaviour When Switching from CPU-Only to CUDA-Enabled Nix Shell

If you have run `cabal` in a CPU-only Hasktorch Nix shell before,
you may need to:

* Clean the `dist-newstyle` folder using `cabal clean`.
* Delete the `.ghc.environment*` file in the Hasktorch root folder.

Otherwise, at best, you will not be able to move tensors to CUDA,
and, at worst, you will see weird linker errors like

```
gcc: error: hasktorch/dist-newstyle/build/x86_64-linux/ghc-8.8.3/libtorch-ffi-1.5.0.0/build/Torch/Internal/Unmanaged/Autograd.dyn_o: No such file or directory
`cc' failed in phase `Linker'. (Exit code: 1)
```

##### CUDA 9

In rare cases, you may want to use `--argstr cudaMajorVersion 9`.
This will pull in version 9 of the CUDA toolkit instead.


### Stack with Nix

It is also possible to compile Hasktorch with Stack while getting system dependencies with Nix.

First, make sure both Stack and Nix are installed, and then optionally enable
the Hasktorch Cachix cache, as described above. After that, just run
`stack --nix build` to build Hasktorch.

As long as you pass the `--nix` flag to Stack, Stack will use Nix to get into
an environment with all required system dependencies (mostly just `libtorch`)
before running builds, tests, etc.

Note that if you are running `stack` with Nix, you want to make sure you have
_not_ run the `deps/get-deps.sh` script. In particular, the `deps/libtorch/` and
`deps/mklml/` directories must not exist.

### Building examples

There are numerous end-to-end training examples in the `examples/` directory of this repository.
These can be built and run in numerous ways,
depending on whether or not you are using Nix or whether you are using Cabal or Stack.

For instance, the the MNIST MLP example can be built and run on CPU with

```sh
$ export DEVICE="cpu"; stack run static-mnist-mlp
```

With Nix, CUDA 10, and cabal, this can be achieved with:

```sh
$ nix-shell \
  --arg cudaSupport true \
  --argstr cudaMajorVersion 10 \
  --command "export DEVICE=\"cuda:0\"; cabal run static-mnist-mlp"
```

### Getting Started With Stack in Nix-shell 

On Linux and OS X the code below will:

 * Drop you into nix-shell with Stack available
 * Build hasktorch and examples with Stack
 * Run unit tests
 * Download MNIST dataset into common directory
 * Find the executable created for static-mnist-cnn
 * Run static-mnist-cnn


```sh
$ nix-shell -p stack
$ stack --nix build
$ stack --nix test
$ cd examples
$ ./datasets/download-mnist.sh 
$ cp -r mnist data
$ find . -type f -executable -name static-mnist-cnn
$ `find . -type f -executable -name static-mnist-cnn`
```


### Set up your development environment

If you want to develop the project with great Haskell IDE integration,
you should consider using [ghcide](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide).
It is the currently preferred language server backend and is provided by the Nix shell environment.
If you are not using Nix, the `ghcide` binary can be installed using `stack` or `cabal`;
see instructions [here](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide#with-cabal-or-stack).

You will then want to install an integration for your preferred editor. `ghcide` supports:

* [VS Code](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide#using-with-vs-code),
* [Atom](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide#using-with-atom),
* [Sublime Text](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide#using-with-sublime-text),
* [Emacs](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide#using-with-emacs),
* [Vim](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide#using-with-vimneovim),
* and [others](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide).

### Getting started with VS Code

This section walks you through the steps of setting up the `ghcide` integration with VS Code.
It assumes that VS Code is already installed system-wide.

First, open a Nix shell and start VS Code:

```sh
$ nix-shell --command "code ."
```

This will work on both macOS and Linux since it is limited to the CPU-only Torch backend.
On Linux, a CUDA-enabled experience is also possible.
Just append `--arg cudaSupport true` and `--argstr cudaMajorVersion 10` to the above `nix-shell` command.

Once VS Code is up an running,
the [Haskell Language Server plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alanz.vscode-hie-server)
needs to be installed.
Follow the link to the market place, and install the plugin in VS Code.

Lastly, in the settings for the plugin, set the `Hie Variant` to `ghcide`.
Changing this setting may require a restart of VS Code.
Afterwards, you should be good to go.

There is a [short YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBYWtrKjKcE) made by [Neil Mitchell](https://twitter.com/@ndm_haskell)
that shows off `ghcide`'s features in VS Code.

## Using Hasktorch as a library in a downstream project via Nix

We have a made a [Hasktorch Skeleton](https://github.com/hasktorch/hasktorch-skeleton) project that people can clone and start working with.


## Jupyter Lab

We provide a special Nix shell environment with Jupyter Lab and Hasktorch.

```sh
$ nix-shell ./nix/jupyter-shell.nix --command "jupyter lab"
```

This will first build various dependencies and then launch Jupyter Lab as well as open it in your default browser.

Some example notebooks are found in the `notebooks/` directory.
