{- | Hasktorch is a library for tensor math and differentiable
     programming in Haskell. It shares the backend C++ libtorch
     library used by PyTorch and serves three primary objectives:

    * Research on new functional programming methodology for
      developing and representing models that are more productive or
      lead to algorithm innovations.

    * Building machine learning systems that are more reliable for the
      model and its integration with the software in which the model
      is embedded.

    * Dissemination of new ideas from typed pure functional
      programming for machine learning to other languages and machine
      learning ecosystems.

   In the following section we introduce Hasktorch usage at a high
   level from an end-user perspective. In the sections that follow we
   will delve into the underlying implementation concepts.

   The sequence of topics and examples here is loosely based on the
   PyTorch tutorial "Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz" by
   Soumith Chintala.
